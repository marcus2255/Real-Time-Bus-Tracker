# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Discriptions
This application uses MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. I then added animated markers on the map to highlight the bus routes. When you click show stops between MIT and Harvard, you will see the marker move across the map.

## Future Work
I want to add more stops to show. I want to create a simulation of stops between my house and downtown Detroit near the river walk.
